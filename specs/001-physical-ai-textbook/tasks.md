## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T446 Perform overall textbook consistency review across all modules
- [ ] T447 Verify minimum 50% peer-reviewed sources requirement across all chapters
- [ ] T448 Perform final academic rigor validation across entire textbook
- [ ] T449 Test all AI-agent prompts for functionality and context appropriateness
- [ ] T450 Validate all practical labs work in simulation environment
- [ ] T451 Verify Docusaurus build completes under 5 minutes
- [ ] T452 Perform final quality validation framework checks
- [ ] T453 Run automated citation verification across all chapters
- [ ] T454 Perform content validation checks for technical accuracy
- [ ] T455 Verify all system architecture explanations are accurate and implementable
- [ ] T456 Test GitHub Pages deployment with full textbook content
- [ ] T457 Perform final cross-module consistency check for capstone alignment
- [ ] T458 Create final deployment package for Panaversity infrastructure
- [ ] T459 Document any remaining open research questions or content gaps
- [ ] T460 Prepare textbook for AI-agent augmentation (tutors, reviewers, copilots)

## Dependencies

- User Story 1 (Module 1) must be completed before User Story 2 (Module 2)
- User Story 2 (Module 2) must be completed before User Story 3 (Module 3)
- User Story 3 (Module 3) must be completed before User Story 4 (Module 4)
- User Story 4 (Module 4) represents the capstone and finalizes the textbook

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Within each module, chapters can be developed in parallel by different team members
- Chapter 1 content development can happen in parallel with Chapter 2 research phase
- AI-agent prompts can be created in parallel with content development
- Citation verification can run in parallel with content writing
- Quality validation checks can run in parallel for different modules

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP Scope**: Complete User Story 1 (Module 1) as the minimum viable product
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Each module represents a deliverable increment
3. **Parallel Development**: Chapters within modules can be developed simultaneously
4. **Continuous Validation**: Quality checks happen throughout development process
