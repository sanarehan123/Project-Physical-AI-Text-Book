# Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Landscape

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the overview of humanoid and legged robots
- Describe degrees of freedom, actuation, and compliance in humanoid robots
- Analyze case studies from research and industry

## Conceptual Foundations

Humanoid robots are designed with human-like form factors to operate effectively in human environments. This chapter explores the landscape of humanoid robotics, including different approaches, capabilities, and applications.

### What Defines a Humanoid Robot?

Humanoid robots are characterized by:

- **Bipedal locomotion**: Ability to walk on two legs
- **Human-like proportions**: Similar body structure to humans
- **Manipulation capabilities**: Arms and hands for object interaction
- **Human-centered design**: Optimized for human environments

### Degrees of Freedom and Actuation

Humanoid robots typically have 20-40+ degrees of freedom (DOF), distributed across:

- **Legs**: 6 DOF each (hip, knee, ankle)
- **Arms**: 7 DOF each (shoulder, elbow, wrist)
- **Torso**: 1-3 DOF for balance
- **Head/neck**: 2-3 DOF for orientation

### Compliance and Safety

Modern humanoid robots incorporate compliance mechanisms:

- **Series Elastic Actuators (SEA)**: Provide safe, compliant interaction
- **Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSA)**: Adjust compliance based on task
- **Passive compliance**: Mechanical compliance for safety

## System Architecture

Humanoid robot architecture typically includes:

1. **High-level planner**: Task and motion planning
2. **Balance controller**: Maintain stability during locomotion
3. **Trajectory generator**: Generate joint trajectories
4. **Low-level controllers**: Execute precise motor commands

### Control Hierarchy

```
Task Planner → Motion Planner → Balance Controller → Trajectory Generator → Joint Controllers
```

## Practical Labs / Simulations

### Lab 2.1: Humanoid Robot Models
- **Requirements**: Gazebo simulation environment, ROS 2 installation
- **Tools**: Gazebo, ROS 2
- **Complexity**: Beginner
- **Steps**:
  1. Load different humanoid robot models in Gazebo
  2. Examine joint configurations and degrees of freedom
  3. Visualize robot kinematics and workspace
- **Expected Outcome**: Student can identify key components and configurations of humanoid robots
