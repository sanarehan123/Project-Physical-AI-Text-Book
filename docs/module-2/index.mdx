# Module 2: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Theme:** Middleware for Embodied Intelligence

This module focuses on ROS 2 as the middleware framework that connects AI agents to physical robot controllers, enabling the development of embodied intelligence systems.

## Overview

This module covers:
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Python agents with ROS 2 integration
- Robot description and URDF format
- ROS 2 systems engineering and best practices

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services, actions)
- Create Python agents that communicate with ROS 2
- Model robot kinematics using URDF
- Implement proper ROS 2 systems engineering practices

## Prerequisites

Students should have completed Module 1 and have basic Python programming knowledge.

## Capstone Alignment

This module provides the essential middleware knowledge needed to connect AI systems to robot hardware, which is crucial for the capstone project.
