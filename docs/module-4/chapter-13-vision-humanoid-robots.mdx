# Chapter 13: Vision for Humanoid Robots

## Learning Objectives

- Implement object detection and scene understanding for humanoid robots
- Design perception pipelines for manipulation tasks
- Understand vision systems optimized for humanoid robot applications

## Conceptual Foundations

Vision systems for humanoid robots must handle the unique challenges of operating in human environments while supporting the robot's physical interaction capabilities. This includes recognizing objects, understanding scenes, and providing real-time feedback for manipulation and navigation.

### Object Detection and Recognition

#### Deep Learning Approaches
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Real-time object detection for robotics
- **Mask R-CNN**: Instance segmentation for precise object boundaries
- **Vision Transformers**: Attention-based models for complex scene understanding
- **Multi-task learning**: Joint detection, segmentation, and attribute prediction

#### Humanoid-Specific Considerations
- **Scale variation**: Objects at different distances and scales
- **Occlusion handling**: Dealing with partial object visibility
- **Lighting conditions**: Robustness to varying illumination
- **Real-time constraints**: Processing speed requirements for robot control

### Scene Understanding

#### 3D Scene Reconstruction
- **Depth estimation**: Monocular, stereo, and LiDAR-based depth
- **Surface normals**: Understanding object orientation and shape
- **Semantic segmentation**: Pixel-level scene understanding
- **Instance segmentation**: Individual object identification in scenes

#### Spatial Reasoning
- **Object affordances**: Understanding how objects can be used
- **Support relationships**: Understanding object placement and stability
- **Navigable space**: Identifying walkable areas and obstacles
- **Human activity recognition**: Understanding human actions and intentions

### Manipulation Perception

#### Grasp Detection
- **6-DOF pose estimation**: Object position and orientation for grasping
- **Grasp planning**: Identifying optimal grasp points and orientations
- **Contact point prediction**: Predicting stable contact points
- **Force estimation**: Estimating required forces for successful grasping

#### Tool Use Understanding
- **Functional parts**: Identifying functional components of tools
- **Usage patterns**: Understanding how objects are typically used
- **Context awareness**: Recognizing appropriate tool use in context
- **Safety considerations**: Identifying safe and unsafe object interactions

## System Architecture

Vision systems for humanoid robots typically follow this architecture:

```
Camera Input → Preprocessing → Feature Extraction → Object Detection → Action Planning
      ↓            ↓                 ↓                   ↓                ↓
   Raw Images   Noise Reduction   Deep Features    Object Labels    Robot Actions
   & Sensors    & Calibration     & Embeddings     & Properties     & Behaviors
```

### Integration Points
- **Sensor fusion**: Combining vision with other modalities (LiDAR, IMU)
- **Robot state**: Incorporating robot pose and joint angles
- **Task context**: Using high-level goals to guide vision processing
- **Memory systems**: Maintaining object and scene representations over time

## Practical Labs / Simulations

### Lab 13.1: Vision System for Humanoid Robot
