## Prompt

```
/sp.plan

Project: Development Plan — Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics AI-Native Textbook

Purpose:
Create a clear, executable development plan for building and deploying the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" textbook using Docusaurus. The plan must support a spec-driven, AI-native authoring workflow compatible with Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code, and result in a production-ready GitHub Pages site.

Scope:
This plan governs repository setup, Docusaurus configuration, content production phases, and chapter/lesson file organization. It does not define curriculum content itself (covered in specifications).

---

## 1. Docusaurus Setup & Configuration

### 1.1 Initial Project Setup
- Initialize a Git repository: `physical-ai-humanoid-robotics`
- Node.js: LTS version required
- Package manager: npm or pnpm (consistent across repo)
- Create Docusaurus site:
  - Template: `classic`
  - Language: TypeScript
  - Docs-only mode (no blog)

### 1.2 Core Configuration (`docusaurus.config.ts`)
- Site title: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
- Tagline: AI Systems in the Physical World
- Base URL and deployment settings:
  - `url`: GitHub Pages domain
  - `baseUrl`: `/physical-ai-humanoid-robotics/`
- Enable:
  - Docs sidebar
  - MDX support
  - Syntax highlighting for Python, YAML, Bash
- Disable unused features (blog, pages) unless explicitly required
- Add math and diagram support (KaTeX, Mermaid) if needed

### 1.3 Documentation Configuration
- Single docs instance (no multi-instance complexity)
- Sidebar autogenerated but grouped manually by module
- Edit URL linked to GitHub repository
- Versioning disabled for first release

### 1.4 GitHub Pages Deployment
- GitHub Actions workflow:
  - Install dependencies
  - Build Docusaurus site
  - Deploy to `gh-pages` branch
- Ensure reproducible builds (lockfile committed)

---

## 2. Content Development Phases

### Phase 1: Specification Authoring (Spec-First)
- Create detailed chapter specs using Spec-Kit Plus
- One spec file per chapter
- Specs must define:
  - Learning objectives
  - Section breakdown
  - Labs and simulations
  - AI-agent prompts
- No prose written before spec approval

### Phase 2: Prose Generation (Claude Code)
- Generate MDX content strictly from approved specs
- Maintain consistent tone, terminology, and structure
- Enforce citation rules and academic rigor
- Validate content against constitution constraints

### Phase 3: Technical Integration
- Insert code blocks, callouts, and diagrams
- Validate MDX rendering locally
- Ensure internal links and sidebar navigation work correctly

### Phase 4: Review & Quality Assurance
- Plagiarism and citation checks
- Consistency review across chapters
- Build and deploy preview site
- Fix formatting, hierarchy, and navigation issues

### Phase 5: Final Deployment
- Tag release version
- Deploy to GitHub Pages
- Freeze content for academic use

## 3. File Structure for Chapters & Lessons

The repository must follow a **predictable, scalable structure** aligned with modules and weeks.
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. The plan includes:
- Technical context with Node.js LTS, Docusaurus v3+, TypeScript
- Constitution compliance check confirming all principles are met
- Detailed project structure with 4 modules and 16 chapters as required
- Research summary documenting technology decisions
- Data model for textbook content entities
- Quickstart guide for developers
- API contract for content management

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and content-api.yaml
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The plan comprehensively covers the Docusaurus-based textbook implementation with proper academic rigor and technical constraints.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - all requirements met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate tasks for implementation
