# ADR-004: AI-Native Pedagogy with Embedded Tutor Prompts

## Title
AI-Native Pedagogy with Embedded Tutor Prompts

## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook needs to leverage AI capabilities to enhance learning experiences. Traditional textbooks have static content, but an AI-native approach could provide personalized tutoring, debugging assistance, and contextual explanations. The integration of AI agents must be seamless and pedagogically effective.

## Decision
We will embed AI-agent prompts throughout the content in three categories: tutor prompts for conceptual understanding, debugging prompts for troubleshooting, and explanation prompts for deeper comprehension. These will be integrated into every chapter to create an AI-native learning experience.

## Alternatives Considered
1. Traditional static content without AI integration
2. Separate AI tutoring system - External to the textbook
3. End-of-chapter AI prompts only - Limited integration
4. AI-powered search and Q&A - Post-content assistance only
5. Minimal AI integration - Only in complex chapters

## Tradeoffs
**Benefits:**
- Personalized learning experience for each student
- Immediate assistance with complex concepts
- Interactive debugging support
- Scalable tutoring without human intervention
- Context-aware explanations
- Adaptive to different learning styles

**Costs/Risks:**
- Dependency on AI service availability and quality
- Potential for students to rely too heavily on AI
- Complexity in creating effective prompts
- Need for ongoing prompt refinement
- Possible reduction in critical thinking if overused
- Additional maintenance of AI prompt library

## Consequences
- Every chapter must include tutor, debugging, and explanation prompts
- Content structure must accommodate AI interaction points
- Quality assurance includes prompt effectiveness testing
- Students expect interactive assistance throughout learning
- Future updates must maintain AI prompt consistency
- Textbook becomes a platform for AI-agent interactions
