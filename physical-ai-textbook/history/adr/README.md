- **Decision**: Use ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim combination
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-12-17

## Purpose

These ADRs document the key architectural decisions made during the planning phase of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. They provide context for future contributors and maintainers, explaining why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives, and outlining the tradeoffs and consequences of each decision.

## Review Process

These decisions should be revisited if:
- Technology landscapes change significantly
- New pedagogical approaches prove more effective
- Student feedback indicates major issues with current approaches
- Resource constraints require different solutions
