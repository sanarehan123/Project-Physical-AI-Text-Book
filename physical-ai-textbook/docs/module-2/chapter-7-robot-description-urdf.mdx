# Chapter 7: Robot Description & URDF

## Learning Objectives

- Understand URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and SDF formats
- Model humanoid kinematics using URDF
- Define joint limits and collision models for robots

## Conceptual Foundations

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is the standard XML-based format for describing robot models in ROS. It defines the physical and visual properties of robots, enabling simulation, visualization, and control across different ROS tools.

### URDF Structure

#### Robot Definition
- **Robot tag**: Root element containing the robot description
- **Links**: Rigid bodies that make up the robot structure
- **Joints**: Connections between links with specific kinematic properties
- **Materials**: Visual appearance properties for rendering

#### Link Elements
- **Inertial properties**: Mass, center of mass, and inertia tensor
- **Visual properties**: Meshes, colors, and visual appearance
- **Collision properties**: Shapes used for collision detection

#### Joint Elements
- **Joint types**: Fixed, continuous, revolute, prismatic, floating, planar
- **Joint limits**: Position, velocity, and effort constraints
- **Axis definitions**: Direction of joint movement
- **Dynamics properties**: Damping and friction coefficients

### SDF Format

#### Gazebo Integration
- **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: Gazebo's native format
- **URDF to SDF**: Automatic conversion for simulation
- **Gazebo-specific elements**: Plugins, sensors, physics properties

#### Advanced Features
- **Transmission elements**: Motor and actuator models
- **Gazebo plugins**: Simulation-specific behaviors
- **Sensor definitions**: Integrated sensor models

### Humanoid Kinematics

#### Kinematic Chains
- **Forward kinematics**: Calculating end-effector position from joint angles
- **Inverse kinematics**: Calculating joint angles for desired end-effector position
- **Kinematic constraints**: Joint limits and workspace boundaries

#### Humanoid-Specific Considerations
- **Bipedal structure**: Two legs with specific kinematic requirements
- **Balance constraints**: Center of mass and support polygon considerations
- **Manipulation workspace**: Arm reach and dexterity requirements

## System Architecture

URDF integrates with the ROS ecosystem through:

```
URDF File → Robot State Publisher → TF Transformations → Visualization & Control
     ↓           ↓                       ↓                  ↓
  Kinematics  Joint States         Robot Pose        MoveIt! Planning
  Model       Broadcasting         Broadcasting      & Control
```

### Key Components
- **robot_state_publisher**: Broadcasts joint states as transforms
- **joint_state_publisher**: Provides joint position data
- **TF system**: Maintains coordinate frame relationships
- **MoveIt!**: Uses URDF for motion planning

## Practical Labs / Simulations

### Lab 7.1: URDF Robot Model Creation
- **Requirements**: ROS 2 installation, basic XML knowledge
- **Tools**: ROS 2, Gazebo, RViz
- **Complexity**: Intermediate
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a simple URDF file for a basic robot
  2. Load the robot model in RViz for visualization
  3. Simulate the robot in Gazebo
  4. Add joint limits and collision properties
- **Expected Outcome**: Student can create and visualize basic robot models in URDF
