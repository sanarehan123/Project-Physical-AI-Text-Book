# Module 3: Digital Twins & AI-Robot Brains

**Theme:** Simulation, Perception, and Learning

This module explores simulation environments and AI systems that form the "brains" of humanoid robots, focusing on perception, learning, and digital twin technologies.

## Overview

This module covers:
- Gazebo physics simulation and sensor modeling
- Unity for human-robot interaction visualization
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic simulation
- Isaac ROS for hardware-accelerated navigation

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Create physics simulations with realistic sensor models in Gazebo
- Design human-robot interaction scenarios in Unity
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception with Isaac ROS

## Prerequisites

Students should have completed Modules 1 and 2, with understanding of Physical AI fundamentals and ROS 2 middleware.

## Capstone Alignment

This module provides the simulation and perception capabilities needed for developing and testing autonomous humanoid systems before deployment.
