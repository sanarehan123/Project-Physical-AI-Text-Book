# Module 1: Foundations of Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

**Theme:** From Digital AI to Intelligence in the Physical World

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence, exploring how AI systems can be extended from digital environments into physical robots that interact with the real world.

## Overview

This module covers:
- Definition of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Limitations of purely digital AI
- Why humanoid robots matter in human environments
- Overview of humanoid and legged robots
- Sensor systems as perception organs
- Physical constraints and reality gaps

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, students will be able to:
- Define Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Explain the limitations of purely digital AI systems
- Understand why humanoid robots are important in human environments
- Identify different types of humanoid and legged robots
- Describe fundamental sensor systems used in robotics
- Understand the challenges of bridging simulation and reality

## Prerequisites

Students should have basic knowledge of AI and machine learning concepts before starting this module.

## Capstone Alignment

This module lays the foundation for understanding how AI systems can be embodied in physical robots, which is essential for the final autonomous humanoid capstone project.
