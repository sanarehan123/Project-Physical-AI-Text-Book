# ADR-003: Research-Concurrent Writing Methodology

## Title
Research-Concurrent Writing Methodology

## Context
The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook requires academic rigor with verifiable sources and peer-reviewed content. The writing process must ensure that all technical claims are substantiated while maintaining momentum in content creation. Traditional approaches include writing first then researching, or completing all research before writing begins.

## Decision
We will use a research-concurrent writing model where research and content creation proceed together. Authors identify claims, verify sources, write content, and insert citations in real-time during the writing process, rather than as a separate phase.

## Alternatives Considered
1. Research-first approach - Complete all research before writing begins
2. Write-first approach - Create content drafts then add citations retroactively
3. Hybrid approach - Research in chunks before writing corresponding sections
4. Parallel teams - Separate research and writing teams
5. Iterative approach - Multiple cycles of writing and research refinement

## Tradeoffs
**Benefits:**
- Ensures all claims have immediate verification
- Maintains academic rigor throughout the process
- Reduces risk of inserting unverifiable content
- Enables real-time fact-checking
- Creates more accurate content from the start
- Reduces rework from citation gaps

**Costs/Risks:**
- Slower initial writing pace due to constant verification
- Higher cognitive load on authors during writing
- Potential interruption of creative flow
- Requires discipline to maintain concurrent process
- May slow initial content production rates

## Consequences
- Authors must interrupt writing flow for source verification
- Content quality remains high throughout development
- Citation gaps are minimized or eliminated
- Peer reviewers can trust technical claims
- Revision cycles are reduced due to early verification
- Writers need access to research databases during composition
